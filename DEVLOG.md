## 2026-05-20 — Merge update/dependencies → main + bump to v0.25.3-multivid

**Done:**
- Merged `update/dependencies` into `main` (no-ff merge commit).
- Bumped version to `0.25.3-multivid` (`package.json` + `package-lock.json`).

**What this release contains over v0.25.2-multivid:**
- All dependency updates (electron-forge 7.11.1, TypeScript 5.9.3, chakra-ui 2.10.9, react 18.3.1, vite 5.4.21, etc.)
- GitHub Actions updated to `actions/checkout@v4` / `actions/setup-node@v4` (all 8 workflow files)
- Compatibility fixes: patch-package removal, rregex pinned to 1.10.11, chakra sub-packages explicitly listed
- `run-test.bat` now auto-pulls, installs with `--legacy-peer-deps`, and handles errors
- 8 TypeScript 5.9 errors resolved in upstream files

**Release attempt 1 failed:** all CI workflows use `npm ci` which doesn't accept the peer-dep conflict. Fixed by adding `--legacy-peer-deps` to every `npm ci` step across all 5 workflow files (`release.yml`, `release-test.yml`, `lint-frontend.yml`, `test-frontend.yml`, `make.yml`). Tag moved forward to include the fix.

**Next:** Monitor release workflow run for v0.25.3-multivid.

## 2026-05-20 — Fix TypeScript 5.9 errors (branch: update/dependencies)

**All 8 upstream TypeScript errors resolved. `npm run type-check:js` passes clean.**

Fixes applied (all in upstream files — minimal, surgical casts only):

| File | Error | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| `src/main/arguments.ts` (×4) | yargs `parseSync()` infers props as `unknown` in TS 5.9 | Added `as string \| undefined` / `as boolean` / `as string` casts at return sites |
| `src/main/squirrel.ts` (×1) | `rmdirSync` with `{recursive}` option removed from `@types/node` | Replaced with `rmSync(p, { recursive: true, force: true })` (modern Node API) |
| `src/renderer/components/node/NodeInputs.tsx` (×1) | `React.memo` return type broadened to `ReactNode` (includes `undefined`) in `@types/react@18.3`, incompatible with `InputItemRenderer` (`JSX.Element \| null`) | Cast memo component `as unknown as InputItemRenderer` |
| `src/renderer/components/NodeDocumentation/NodeDocs.tsx` (×2) | `item.id` typed as `InputId \| OutputId` in union component; `Array.includes` requires exact element type in TS 5.9 | Imported `InputId`/`OutputId`; added targeted casts in each ternary branch |

**Next:** Merge `update/dependencies` → `main`.

## 2026-05-19 — Vulnerability audit + compatibility fixes (branch: update/dependencies)

**App status:** working on Windows and Mac after the fixes below.

**Compatibility issues resolved during testing:**
- `patch-package` was erroring on every install because the patch targeted `@electron-forge/plugin-vite@7.4.0/dist/util/package.js` — that file no longer exists in 7.11.1. Patch deleted.
- `rregex@1.11.0` removed the `./lib/rregex.wasm` and `./lib/web` subpath exports that `src/common/rust-regex.ts` imports. Pinned back to `1.10.11` (exact, no `^`).
- `@chakra-ui/react@2.10.9` no longer installs `@chakra-ui/layout`, `@chakra-ui/image`, `@chakra-ui/checkbox`, `@chakra-ui/table`, `@chakra-ui/system` as transitive deps. `chakra-ui-markdown-renderer@4.1.0` imports them directly so they are now listed explicitly in `package.json`.
- `run-test.bat`: added `git pull` step, `call` prefix on all npm commands (missing `call` causes the cmd window to silently exit when npm finishes on Windows), `--no-audit` flag, and error pausing.

**npm audit — 47 vulnerabilities (6 low, 10 moderate, 31 high):**
All require breaking changes to fix — none were resolved by `npm audit fix`. The original upstream chaiNNer repo carries the same vulnerabilities.

| Group | Severity | Fix needed | Status |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Electron 25.x CVEs (18 issues) | High | Electron 42 | Deferred — dedicated upgrade effort |
| `@electron-forge` chain | Mixed | Forge v8 (alpha) | Deferred — pre-release |
| `@octokit` ReDoS | Moderate | `@octokit/rest` v22 | Deferred — publish-only, not runtime |
| `esbuild` dev server | Moderate | esbuild update | Dev-only, no production impact |
| `tmp` via inquirer | Low | Would downgrade forge | Skip |

Electron CVEs are the most notable but require a targeted Electron upgrade as a separate branch/effort. For a local desktop tool the practical attack surface is narrow.

**Dart Sass legacy-js-api warnings:** cosmetic, emitted by Vite's Sass integration. No action needed until Dart Sass 2.0 is released.

**Known TypeScript errors (8):** surfaced by TypeScript 5.9 being stricter than 5.0. All in upstream files, none in our feature code. To fix before merging to main.

**Next:** Fix the 8 TS type errors, then merge `update/dependencies` → `main`.

## 2026-05-19 — Dependency updates (branch: update/dependencies)

**Approach:** patch/minor bumps only. Major version jumps skipped (React 19, Chakra 3, Electron 42, uuid 14, prettier 3, stylelint 17, use-context-selector 2, etc.) — each would require targeted code changes and testing.

**npm packages updated:**
- `electron` 25.8.4 → 25.9.8 (within v25, via `npm update`)
- `@electron-forge/*` 7.4.0 → 7.11.1 (all packages, manually — were pinned)
- `typescript` 5.0.4 → 5.9.3 (latest v5)
- `vite` 5.4.6 → 5.4.21
- `vitest` 1.4.0 → 1.6.1
- `react` / `react-dom` 18.1.0 → 18.3.1 (stayed in v18)
- `@chakra-ui/react` 2.8.2 → 2.10.9 (stayed in v2)
- `@emotion/react` / `@emotion/styled` → latest v11
- `@types/react` / `@types/react-dom` → latest v18
- `use-context-selector` 1.4.0 → 1.4.4
- All other patch/minor deps via `npm update --legacy-peer-deps`

**GitHub Actions updated:**
- `actions/checkout@v3` → `actions/checkout@v4` (all 8 workflow files)
- `actions/setup-node@v3` → `actions/setup-node@v4` (all applicable files)

**Peer dependency notes:**
- `eslint-plugin-prefer-arrow-functions` pinned to `3.1.4` (v3.9.1 requires eslint 9; project stays on eslint 8)
- `--legacy-peer-deps` used throughout because `use-context-selector@1.4.4` pulls in a `react-native` optional peer that wants `@types/react@^19`

**Python backend packages:** left as-is. chaiNNer uses its own package installer; versions are pinned by the upstream team for inter-package compatibility. PyTorch is already at 2.7.0 (current). Updating these without testing the ML pipeline is too risky.

**Known type errors after update (8 total — all in upstream files, not our code):**
TypeScript 5.9 is stricter than 5.0 and caught pre-existing issues:
- `src/main/arguments.ts` (4 errors) — `unknown` type narrowing now required
- `src/main/squirrel.ts` (1 error) — function arity changed in a dependency
- `src/renderer/components/node/NodeInputs.tsx` (1 error) — `memo` type tightened in `@types/react@18.3`
- `src/renderer/components/NodeDocumentation/NodeDocs.tsx` (2 errors) — `InputId`/`OutputId` union narrowing

These need to be fixed before merging to main. Diagnose per-error during testing.

**Next:** Test the app, fix the 8 type errors, then merge `update/dependencies` → `main`.

## 2026-05-19 — Release v0.25.2-multivid

**Done:**
- Bumped version to `0.25.2-multivid` in `package.json` / `package-lock.json`.
- Merged `feature/multi-video-batch` into `main` via PR #1.
- Tagged `v0.25.2-multivid` and triggered the inherited `release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.

**Two bugs fixed before the release build succeeded:**

1. **Wrong publish target** — `forge.config.js` used `packageJson.author.name` / `packageJson.productName` to build the GitHub repo path, which resolved to `chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer` (the upstream). The `GITHUB_TOKEN` has no write access there. Fixed by hardcoding `owner: 'wyghst', name: 'chainner-multivid'` in the publisher config.

2. **Token write permission** — even after fixing the repo path, the token was blocked. Required two steps: (a) add `permissions: contents: write` to the release workflow job, and (b) set the repo's Actions workflow permissions to "Read and write" under Settings → Actions → General.

**How to release in future:** bump version with `npm version <ver> --no-git-tag-version`, commit, push to `main`, then `git tag v<ver> && git push origin v<ver>`. The workflow fires automatically.

## 2026-05-19 — Feature complete + merge to main

**Done:**
- Confirmed Resize To Side "Force Even Dimensions" toggle works end-to-end.
- Full Phase 4 verification passed: Load Videos → Resize To Side → Save Videos chain produces one output file per source video with correct audio, FPS, directory, and even-pixel dimensions.
- Merged `feature/multi-video-batch` into `main` via PR #1.

**Feature summary (all shipped):**
- `Load Videos` generator node — scans a folder, iterates all frames from all videos as one flat stream; outputs Frame, FrameIndex, VideoIndex, VideoName, FPS, AudioStream (iterated), TotalVideos, Directory (static)
- `Save Videos` collector node — detects VideoName change to open a new FFmpeg writer per source video; carries audio and native FPS through
- `Resize To Side` — new "Force Even Dimensions" toggle snaps output to nearest even pixel, satisfying H.264/H.265 libx265

**Status:** Complete. No open items.

---

## 2026-05-19 — Force Even Dimensions option on Resize To Side

**Done:**
- Added `BoolInput("Force Even Dimensions", default=False)` to `resize_to_side.py` (input id=5).
- Updated navi `image_type` expression to apply `round(d / 2) * 2` when `Input5` is true.
- Updated `resize_to_side_node` function signature with `force_even: bool` parameter.
- Added even-snap logic in body: `out_w = max(out_w - out_w % 2, 2)` and same for height.
- When enabled, both width and height are snapped **down** to the nearest even pixel (minimum 2), satisfying H.264/H.265 libx265 requirements.

**Next:** Phase 4 end-to-end test with all connections wired.

---

## 2026-05-19 — Audio passthrough + Directory output

**Done:**
- **Load Videos**: added Audio Stream (iterated output 5, per-video ffmpeg stream), Total Videos moved to output 6, Directory added as output 7 (non-iterated, the scanned folder path).
- **Save Videos**: added Audio Stream (iterated input id=15, optional), Audio Settings (non-iterated id=10), wired both through `_open_writer` to the FFmpeg Writer. GIF format forces audio=None. Updated `IteratorInputInfo` to `[0, 1, 14, 15]` and `on_iterate` unpacks a 4-tuple `(frame, video_name, fps, audio)`.

**How to wire the new outputs:**
- `Load Videos: Audio Stream` → `Save Videos: Audio Stream` — audio carried through per video
- `Load Videos: Directory` → `Save Videos: Directory` — outputs land in same folder as inputs
- `Load Videos: FPS` → `Save Videos: FPS` — native FPS per video

**Deferred:** Auto frame size with even horizontal pixels — likely needs a new node; user chose to hold off.

**Next:** Phase 4 — full end-to-end test with all connections wired.

---

## 2026-05-19 — End of session

**Current state:** All code committed and pushed. `Load Videos` + `Save Videos` nodes registered correctly after DirectoryInput bug fix.

**What's on the branch (`feature/multi-video-batch`):**
- `backend/.../video_frames/load_videos.py` — Load Videos generator node (fixed)
- `backend/.../video_frames/save_videos.py` — Save Videos collector node
- `run-test.bat` / `run-test.sh` — one-click test launchers
- `CLAUDE.md`, `DEVLOG.md`, `PLAN.md` — all current

**Next session:** Phase 4 — launch app, confirm both nodes appear under Video Frames, wire up Load Videos → Save Videos with Video Name connected, run with 3+ videos, verify one output file per input video.

---

## 2026-05-19 — Bug fix: Load Videos node not appearing

**Problem:** `Load Videos` node was silently failing to register — not visible in the node selector on Mac or Windows.

**Root cause:** `load_videos.py` called `DirectoryInput(primary_input=True)`. `DirectoryInput.__init__` does not accept `primary_input` (only `FileInput` subclasses do). This raised `TypeError` at import time, caught silently by `load_nodes()`, so the node never registered.

**Fix:** Changed to `DirectoryInput()` (no argument). One-line diff.

**Next:** Re-run the app and confirm both Load Videos and Save Videos nodes appear under Video Frames.

---

## 2026-05-19 — End of session (node-based pivot complete)

**Current state:** `load_videos.py` + `save_videos.py` implemented and pushed. Frontend header approach fully reverted. TypeScript type-check clean. Python nodes awaiting Phase 4 manual test.

**What's on the branch (`feature/multi-video-batch`):**
- `backend/.../video_frames/load_videos.py` — Load Videos generator node
- `backend/.../video_frames/save_videos.py` — Save Videos collector node
- `run-test.bat` / `run-test.sh` — one-click test launchers
- `CLAUDE.md`, `DEVLOG.md`, `PLAN.md` — all current

**Next session:** Launch app via `run-test.bat`, add Load Videos + Save Videos to a chain, connect Video Name output to Video Name input, run with 3+ test videos, confirm one output file per input video.

---

## 2026-05-19 — Phase 3 Revision: Node-based batch approach

**Done:**
- **Reverted** frontend header approach: deleted `BatchExecutionContext.tsx`, `BatchControls.tsx`; reverted `main.tsx` and `Header.tsx` to pre-batch state. TypeScript type check passes clean.
- **Created `backend/src/packages/chaiNNer_standard/image/video_frames/load_videos.py`**: `Load Videos` generator node. Takes a DirectoryInput, scans for video files (`.mp4 .mkv .avi .mov .webm .gif .m4v .wmv`), iterates all frames from all videos as one flat sequence. Iterated outputs: Frame, FrameIndex, VideoIndex, VideoName, FPS. Non-iterated: TotalVideos. Auto-discovered by chaiNNer's node loader.
- **Created `backend/src/packages/chaiNNer_standard/image/video_frames/save_videos.py`**: `Save Videos` collector node. Iterated inputs: Frame + VideoName. Non-iterated: Directory, FPS, format/encoder settings (same options as Save Video, reusing Writer/enums via import). Detects VideoName change → closes previous FFmpeg writer, opens a new one. Returns count of videos saved.
- Updated CLAUDE.md, PLAN.md.

**Why the change:** User requested nodes (like "Load Images" for batch images) rather than a header toolbar. Node-based approach is cleaner: the chain topology itself expresses the batch intent, no UI-layer orchestration needed.

**Verification:** `npm run type-check:js` passes clean. Python nodes untested (need app launch for Phase 4).

**Next:** Phase 4 — launch app via `run-test.bat`, place Load Videos + Save Videos nodes in a chain, run batch with 3+ videos, confirm separate output files.

## 2026-05-19 — Pull request opened

**Done:**
- Opened PR #1: https://github.com/wyghst/chainner-multivid/pull/1
- All feature work is visible on GitHub — navigate to the PR or switch to the `feature/multi-video-batch` branch to browse the diff.
- Note: GitHub defaults to showing `main`; the feature branch is separate by design until Phase 4 testing is complete.

---

## 2026-05-19 — End of session status

**Current state:** Phases 0–3 complete and pushed. Awaiting Phase 4 manual testing.

**What's on the branch (`feature/multi-video-batch`):**
- `run-test.bat` / `run-test.sh` — one-click test launchers (Windows / Mac)
- `src/renderer/contexts/BatchExecutionContext.tsx` — batch orchestration
- `src/renderer/components/Header/BatchControls.tsx` — batch UI in header
- `CLAUDE.md`, `DEVLOG.md`, `PLAN.md` — all current

**Uncommitted:** Only CRLF/LF snapshot normalization from running tests on Windows — not committed (no content change).

**Next session:** Run Phase 4 verification (open app via `run-test.bat`, test batch folder run with 3+ videos, test error/retry/summary flow, confirm single-video regression is clean), then Phase 5 finalize.

---

## 2026-05-19 — Test launcher scripts

**Done:**
- Created `run-test.bat` (Windows) and `run-test.sh` (Mac/Linux).
- Both scripts: check for Node.js, run `npm install` if `node_modules` is missing, then launch `npm start` (Electron with integrated Python backend — no manual Python setup required).
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with launch instructions.

**Next:** Manual Phase 4 verification using these scripts.

---

## 2026-05-19 — Phase 3: Implementation

**Done:**
- Created `src/renderer/contexts/BatchExecutionContext.tsx`: batch orchestration context. Provides folder state, `runBatch()`, `cancelBatch()`, progress, and summary. Uses `optimizeChain` + `toBackendJson` to build chain JSON, then patches Load Video input 0 (file path) and Save Video input 2 (name stem) per video before each `backend.run()` call.
- Created `src/renderer/components/Header/BatchControls.tsx`: compact header UI with folder picker button, batch run / cancel button with live N/M count, and a completion modal listing any persistent failures.
- Modified `src/renderer/main.tsx`: added `BatchExecutionProvider` inside `ExecutionProvider`.
- Modified `src/renderer/components/Header/Header.tsx`: added `BatchControls` next to `ExecutionButtons`.

**Verification so far:**
- `npm run type-check:js` passes clean.
- `npx vitest run` — 96/96 tests pass.

**Decisions made:**
- Used `createContext` / `useContext` from `use-context-selector` to match existing codebase pattern.
- `cancelBatch()` sets a ref flag; current video finishes before the loop exits (clean shutdown).
- Snapshot file line-ending changes from running tests on Windows not committed (whitespace only).

**Next:** Phase 4 — manual verification with real test videos.

---

## 2026-05-19 — Phase 1: Codebase Investigation + Phase 2: Plan

**Done:**
- Thoroughly investigated iterator/lineage system, Load Video node, Save Video node, execution engine, frontend trigger, node input UI, and backend API.
- Wrote complete `PLAN.md` proposing frontend batch orchestration approach.

**Key findings:**
- Load Video (`chainner:image:load_video`, `backend/src/packages/chaiNNer_standard/image/video_frames/load_video.py`) takes a single-file path as input 0 — not a directory. Registered as `kind="generator"`.
- Save Video (`chainner:image:save_video`) input 2 is `RelativePathInput("Video Name")` — the output filename stem.
- The `/run` endpoint (`backend/src/server.py:204`) accepts the full chain JSON on each call. Inputs are baked in; no override mechanism exists.
- `DirectoryInput` already exists in both frontend and backend — no new UI primitive needed.
- Single-iterator enforcement: frontend (`src/common/nodes/checkNodeValidity.ts:243`) and backend (`backend/src/process.py:690`). Hard constraint, cannot be worked around.

**Design decision:** Frontend batch orchestration (Option C). Re-run the chain once per video, patching the Load Video node's file path and Save Video's name in the serialized JSON before each `/run` call. No backend changes, no node changes. See `PLAN.md` for full details.

**Next:** Awaiting user approval of `PLAN.md` before Phase 3.

---

## 2026-05-19 — Phase 0: Fork & Scaffold

**Done:**
- Verified `gh` CLI authenticated as `wyghst`
- Forked `chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer` → `wyghst/chainner-multivid` via `gh repo fork`
- Cloned repo; confirmed `origin` → `wyghst/chainner-multivid`, `upstream` → `chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer`
- Created branch `feature/multi-video-batch`
- Created skeleton `CLAUDE.md`, `DEVLOG.md`, `PLAN.md`

**In progress:** Phase 1 investigation, then Phase 2 planning.

**Next:** Explore codebase — iterator/lineage system, Load Video node, Save Video node, execution engine, frontend node input UI.
